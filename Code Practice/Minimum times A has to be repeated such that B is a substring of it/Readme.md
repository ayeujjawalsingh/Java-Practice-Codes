## Minimum times A has to be repeated such that B is a substring of it
Given two strings A and B. Find minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B is a Substring of it. If B can never be a substring then return -1.[üîóGoto](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/5ef42ba605fff6cd60b1b2dd2ee230ade1fa25b0/1#) 

```
Example 1:

Input:
A = "abcd"
B = "cdabcdab"
Output:
3
Explanation:
Repeating A three times (‚Äúabcdabcdabcd‚Äù),
B is a substring of it. B is not a substring
of A when it is repeated less than 3 times.

Example 2:
Input:
A = "ab"
B = "cab"
Output :
-1
Explanation:
No matter how many times we repeat A, we can't
get a string such that B is a substring of it.
