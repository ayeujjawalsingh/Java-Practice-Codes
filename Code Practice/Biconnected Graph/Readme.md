## Biconnected Graph
Given a graph with n vertices, e edges and an array arr[] denoting the edges connected to each other, check whether it is Biconnected or not.
Note: The given graph is Undirected. [ðŸ”—Goto](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/biconnected-graph2528/1#) 

```
Example 1:

Input:
n = 2, e = 1
arr = {0, 1}
Output:
1
Explanation:
       0
      /
     1
The above graph is Biconnected.

Example 2:

Input:
n = 3, e = 2
arr = {0, 1, 1, 2}
Output:
0
Explanation:
       0
